            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                I'm currently a 5th-year student pursuing a BSc Specialization in Computing Science. I have been fascinated with technology from a young age
                and have been amazed by Apple products since the very first iPod.

        <h2>A Brief History</h2>
        <p>
            I have worked with Rogers Communications Inc. for the past 5 years as a part-time Small Business Specialist. During that time, I have learnt that
            we, as Computer Scientists, have a better grasp on how technology works and there is still a void from the general public, where people still learn
            about basic computer skills and the need for help to navigate technology increases as technology advances.

        <h2>Professional Experience</h2>
        <p>
            Motivating and communicating new and existing sales associates to showcase value in additional products and services to achieve store missions 
            and company visions as a trained employee for the role of an Assistant Store Manager. I have also accurately defined problem space and investigated 
            different solution strategies effectively, quickly, and comfortably in diverse school projects and sales procedures in the workplace.
